# 📌 Lofi Jingle

![Project Logo](./public/icons/icon-192.png)

This repo demonstrate the possibility of using [WebSpatial](https://webspatial.dev/) & [React](https://react.dev/) to create a Web App and an Apple VisionOS App at the same time in the same codebase. The app itself is a Lofi Music Player with Spatial UI Layout and Animations.

## 📦 Installation

```

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the web app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run in Vision Pro Simulator:

- Start Dev Server:

```bash
npm run start:avp
```

- Launch in Simulator:

```bash
npm run simulate:avp
```

### Build to Vision Pro:

- Follow Steps in [Build and Publish to VisionOS](https://gist.github.com/dexteryy/9dce5f5b129115f85172f5174f22173d)

- Start Dev Server:

```bash
npm run start:avp
```

- Instead of using the build command from WebSpatial run the following:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy:avp
```

### Build Troubleshooting

- Double check your bundle id and team id

- Delete `dist`, `build`, and `node_modules` directories

- Run `npm install` and try building again

- If all of the above doesn't work, there might be some issues with your xcode setup, run `open node_modules/.webspatial-builder-temp/platform-visionos/project/web-spatial.xcodeproj` to open xcode and build from there

### Publish to TestFlight or App Store

- Follow Steps in [Build and Publish to VisionOS](https://gist.github.com/dexteryy/9dce5f5b129115f85172f5174f22173d)

- Build Production Server:

```bash
npm run build:avp
```

- Before Deployment:

```bash
cd dist
touch vercel.json
```

 - vercel.json content:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/webspatial/avp/(.*)",
      "dest": "/webspatial/avp/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Deploy to Vercel (assuming you have vercel cli installed):

```bash
vercel --prod
```

- Now, if you go to `$BASEURL.vercel.app/webspatial/avp`, you should see the web experience

- In `.env.local`, set `XR_PROD_SERVER` to your `$BASEURL.vercel.app/webspatial/avp`

- Publish

```bash
npm run publish:avp
```
